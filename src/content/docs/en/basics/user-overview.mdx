Paideia LMS has a comprehensive user management system with **two distinct role systems**: system-wide roles and course-specific enrollment roles. This dual role system allows for flexible permissions across the platform.

## System-Wide Roles

There are six system-wide user roles defined in the `users` collection:

1. **`admin`** - Full platform access, can manage all users and system settings
2. **`content-manager`** - Can create courses and manage content
3. **`analytics-viewer`** - View-only access to reports and analytics
4. **`instructor`** - Can create courses and activity modules
5. **`student`** - Default role for new users
6. **`guest`** - *(coming soon)* Limited access for unauthenticated users

These roles control platform-level permissions. For example:
- Only `admin` and `content-manager` can create courses
- `admin`, `instructor`, and `content-manager` can create activity modules
- `admin` users have override permissions across all courses regardless of enrollment

## Course Enrollment Roles

Within courses, users have separate enrollment-specific roles:

1. **`student`** - Enrolled learner in a course
2. **`teacher`** - Course instructor with full course management
3. **`ta`** - Teaching assistant with limited instructor permissions
4. **`manager`** - Course manager role
5. **`guest`** - *(coming soon)* Limited course access for unauthenticated users

These enrollment roles determine what users can do within specific courses:
- `teacher` and `manager` roles can see course settings and participants
- All enrolled users can view course content
- System-wide `admin` users have override permissions regardless of enrollment

## User Entity

The `User` entity is stored in the `users` collection with fields including:

- **Basic profile**: `firstName`, `lastName`, `bio`, `email`
- **System role**: `role` (one of the six system-wide roles)
- **Authentication**: `password`, `sessions`
- **Preferences**: `theme`, `avatar`

## Flexible Permissions

The dual role system allows flexible permissions: a user might be a system-wide `instructor` (able to create courses) while being enrolled as a `student` in specific courses. This design allows users to have different roles in different contexts, providing maximum flexibility for educational institutions.
