When a **Discussion** module is linked to a course, it becomes a **course module** with course-specific settings. Students enrolled in the course can participate in threaded discussions by creating posts and replies, which instructors can moderate and grade.

## What is a Course Module?

A course module is an activity module that has been linked to a specific course. When you link a discussion module to a course:

- The module becomes accessible to students enrolled in that course
- Course-specific settings can override or extend the module's default configuration
- Students can create discussion posts and replies tied to that specific course module
- Instructors can view, moderate, and grade all discussion activity within the course context

## Course-Specific Settings

When a discussion module is added to a course, you can configure course-specific settings that apply only to that course:

### Discussion Dates

- **Open date**: When students can start posting
- **Close date**: When new posts are no longer accepted
- **Lock date**: When threads are locked from further replies

### Posting Settings

- Useful when the same discussion serves different purposes in different courses

## Student Discussion Posts

Students enrolled in the course can create discussion posts and replies. Each post is tied to:

- The **course module** (the discussion as it appears in this course)
- The **student** who created the post

- The **thread** (if replying to an existing post)

### Creating Posts

Students can participate in discussions by:

1. Navigating to the discussion module in the course
2. Clicking "New Post" or "Start Discussion" to create a new thread
3. Entering their post content with rich text formatting
4. Attaching files if allowed
5. Submitting their post

### Replying to Posts

Students can reply to existing posts:

1. Navigating to a discussion thread
2. Clicking "Reply" on a post
3. Entering their reply content
