When a **Quiz** module is linked to a course, it becomes a **course module** with course-specific settings. Students enrolled in the course can take the quiz and create quiz attempts (submissions), which are automatically graded or manually reviewed by instructors.

## Course-Specific Settings

When a quiz module is added to a course, you can configure course-specific settings that apply only to that course:

### Timing Settings

- **Open date**: When students can start taking the quiz
- **Close date**: When the quiz is no longer available
- **Time limit**: Course-specific time limits (for regular quizzes)
- **Nested quiz timers**: Independent timers for each section (for container quizzes)

### Attempt Settings

- **Attempt limits**: Course-specific attempt restrictions
- **Attempt scoring**: How to handle multiple attempts (highest, latest, or average)
- **Access control**: Sequential or free-order access for container quizzes

### Module Name Override

- **Custom name**: Override the default module name for this course
- Useful when the same quiz serves different purposes in different courses

## Student Quiz Attempts

Students enrolled in the course can create quiz attempts (submissions). Each attempt is tied to:

- The **course module** (the quiz as it appears in this course)
- The **student** who created the attempt
- The **attempt date** and time
- The **answers** provided by the student

### Taking a Quiz

Students can take the quiz by:

1. Navigating to the quiz module in the course
2. Clicking "Start Quiz" or "Take Quiz"
3. Answering questions according to the quiz configuration
4. Submitting their answers

### Quiz Types

Quizzes can be configured as:

- **Regular Quiz**: Single continuous quiz with pages of questions
- **Container Quiz**: Multi-section exam with independent sections

### Question Types

Students may encounter various question types:

- **Multiple choice**: Select one correct answer
- **Short answer**: Type a brief response
- **Long answer**: Write a longer response
- **Fill in the blank**: Complete sentences with missing words
- **Choice (checkbox)**: Select multiple correct answers
- **Ranking**: Arrange items in order
- **Matrix**: Select options in a table format
- **Whiteboard**: Draw responses using a canvas

### Auto-Grading

Many question types are automatically graded:

- **Objective questions**: Multiple choice, short answer (with matching), etc.
- **Immediate feedback**: Students can see results for auto-graded questions
- **Partial credit**: Some scoring configurations allow partial credit

## Viewing and Managing Quiz Attempts

Instructors can view and manage all quiz attempts for the course module:

### Attempt List

- **All attempts**: View all student quiz attempts
- **Filter by student**: Filter attempts by specific students
- **Filter by status**: Filter by in progress, submitted, or graded
- **Sort options**: Sort by student name, attempt date, or score
- **Search**: Find specific attempts

### Individual Attempt View

When viewing a quiz attempt, instructors can:

- **View answers**: See all student responses
- **Review auto-grading**: Check automatic scoring results
- **Manual grading**: Grade questions that require manual evaluation
- **Adjust scores**: Modify auto-graded scores if needed
- **Provide feedback**: Add comments on specific questions or overall
- **View attempt history**: See all previous attempts from the student

### Scoring Configurations

Quiz attempts are scored based on the quiz's scoring configuration:

- **Simple**: All-or-nothing points
- **Weighted**: Partial credit with weight multipliers
- **Rubric**: Manual grading using rubrics
- **Manual**: Instructor assigns points manually
- **Partial Match**: Text matching with configurable threshold
- **Ranking**: Points based on correct order
- **Matrix**: Points per row in matrix questions

## Attempt Status

Quiz attempts can have different statuses:

- **In Progress**: Student is currently taking the quiz
- **Submitted**: Student has submitted their answers
- **Auto-Graded**: Automatically scored questions have been evaluated
- **Graded**: All questions have been graded (including manual grading)
- **Returned**: Results have been returned to the student

## Best Practices

When working with quiz course modules:

- **Set appropriate time limits**: Allow students enough time to complete all questions
- **Test the quiz**: Take the quiz yourself before publishing to students
- **Review auto-grading**: Verify that auto-grading configurations are correct
- **Provide feedback**: Add feedback for questions, especially for incorrect answers
- **Monitor attempts**: Check for students who haven't completed the quiz
- **Use container quizzes**: For complex exams with multiple sections
- **Configure access control**: Use sequential order for exams that must be taken in order
