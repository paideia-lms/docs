## The Story Behind Paideia

**Paideia was created by [Hananoshika yomaru](https://yomaru.dev) while working as a Learning Technology Specialist at Trinity Western University in Canada.** Managing Moodle was a constant pain — the platform's complexity made routine tasks difficult, and extending functionality through plugins was problematic. Most third-party Moodle plugins lack proper maintenance, are buggy, and require careful consideration before installation. This plugin dependency creates technical debt and security concerns.

Frustrated with these limitations, Paideia was born from a vision: create an LMS that takes a "batteries included" approach with a modern tech stack. By choosing the right technologies from day one, Paideia keeps technical debt low and is ready for the long journey ahead. No plugins needed for basic features — everything essential is built-in, maintainable, and secure.
