Notes are a personal journaling feature that allows users to create, edit, and manage their own notes. Notes are stored as markdown content and can be shared publicly or kept private.

## What are Notes?

Notes are personal entries that users can create to record thoughts, ideas, observations, or any other content. They function like a digital journal or notebook within the Paideia LMS platform.

Each note contains:
- **Content** - The main text of the note (supports markdown formatting)
- **Visibility** - Can be set as public or private
- **Date** - Automatically tracks when notes are created and updated

## Creating Notes

Users can create notes at any time. When creating a note, you can:

- **Write content** using markdown formatting for rich text
- **Add images** by uploading them directly to your notes
- **Set visibility** to make notes public or keep them private
- **Save and edit** your notes at any time

Notes support rich text formatting, allowing you to create well-structured entries with headings, lists, links, and embedded images.

## Managing Notes

Once created, notes can be managed in several ways:

### Viewing Notes

You can view all your notes in a list view, organized by date. The system also provides:

- **Activity heatmap** - A visual calendar showing when you created notes
- **Date filtering** - Filter notes by specific dates
- **Calendar view** - See your note activity across different dates

### Editing Notes

You can edit your own notes at any time. When editing a note, you can:

- **Update content** - Modify the text and formatting
- **Change visibility** - Switch between public and private
- **Add or remove images** - Update embedded images

### Deleting Notes

You can delete your own notes when they're no longer needed. Deleted notes cannot be recovered, so make sure you want to remove them before confirming deletion.

## Public and Private Notes

Notes can be set as either public or private:

### Private Notes

- **Default setting** - Notes are private by default
- **Only you can see** - Private notes are visible only to you (and administrators)
- **Personal journal** - Use private notes for personal thoughts and reflections

### Public Notes

- **Shared with others** - Public notes can be viewed by anyone logged into the system
- **Optional sharing** - You can choose to make specific notes public
- **Community engagement** - Public notes allow you to share insights and ideas with the community

## Notes in Your Profile

Notes are integrated into your user profile, allowing you to:

- **View your activity** - See when and how often you create notes
- **Track your progress** - Monitor your note-taking habits over time
- **Share with others** - Let others see your public notes when viewing your profile
