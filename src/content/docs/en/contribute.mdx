## Ways to Contribute

### Project repositories

There are lots of ways to contribute to the Paideia LMS Project! Every Paideia LMS repository has a README with a link to a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file in the root of the project.

Visit [Paideia LMS's GitHub profile](https://github.com/paideia-lms) to find the repositories for:

- The [main Paideia LMS codebase](https://github.com/paideia-lms/Paideia), the core Learning Management System.

- [Paideia LMS Docs](https://github.com/paideia-lms/docs), the documentation website built with Astro Starlight! Contribute not just written content, but also code addressing a11y, CSS, UI, and UX concerns. We also make our documentation available in several languages, so we need help translating the entire site.

### Types of contributions

In addition to contributing your own code or content, you can also make a huge contribution by getting involved by leaving review comments on PRs, adding ideas in existing GitHub Issues and Discussions, and participating in our maintenance tasks! 

Every PR, especially translation PRs, needs reviewers! Reviewing PRs and leaving comments, suggestions, or an approving "LGTM!" ("Looks Good To Me!") is a great way to get started in any repository, and to learn more about Paideia LMS.

We value the contributions of those who welcome new members, answer support questions, and share what they have built with and for Paideia LMS! Beyond traditional GitHub contributions, Paideia LMS recognizes and supports community members who engage with our community, share Paideia LMS in blog posts, videos and conference talks, and help maintain the health of our community.

## Contributing to Docs

We have several guides available to assist you with contributing to Paideia LMS Docs.

Whether it's your very first contribution to open-source, or you need to add docs for the new Paideia LMS feature you just built, or you're an experienced translator looking for the next page to translate, or you'd like to learn more about helping as a PR reviewer... we've got you covered! 

Please see our [Contributing Guide](/en/contribute/) for documentation on how to contribute to Paideia LMS Docs as a typo-fixer, a writer, a translator, a feature-builder, and even as a PR reviewer.
