The API reference documentation is currently under development. The API specification is available via OpenAPI and can be accessed at `/openapi.json` on your Paideia LMS instance.
:::

Paideia LMS provides a REST API for programmatic access to the system. The API is documented using the OpenAPI specification, which allows you to explore the available endpoints, request/response schemas, and authentication requirements.

## OpenAPI Specification

Paideia LMS supports OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) and provides the API specification at:

```
/openapi.json
```

You can access this endpoint on any Paideia LMS instance to view the complete API specification. The OpenAPI specification includes:

- All available API endpoints
- Request and response schemas
- Authentication requirements
- Parameter descriptions
- Example requests and responses

## Using the OpenAPI Specification

You can use the OpenAPI specification to:

- **Generate API clients** - Use tools like OpenAPI Generator to create client libraries for your preferred programming language
- **Test endpoints** - Use tools like Swagger UI or Postman to interact with the API
- **Document integration** - Use the specification as a reference for building integrations with Paideia LMS

## Accessing the API

The OpenAPI specification is publicly accessible at `/openapi.json` on your Paideia LMS instance. This allows developers and tools to discover and understand the available API endpoints without requiring authentication.

For actual API access, you will need to authenticate using the appropriate authentication method configured in your Paideia LMS instance.

## Example Usage

To view the OpenAPI specification, you can:

1. **Direct URL access**: Navigate to `https://your-paideia-instance.com/openapi.json` in your browser
2. **Using curl**: `curl https://your-paideia-instance.com/openapi.json`
