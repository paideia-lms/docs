The **Page** module is a read-only activity module that allows instructors to create static instructional content using rich text HTML. This module type is ideal for presenting course materials, lecture notes, and other informational content.

## Overview

Page modules are informative (read-only) modules that present content without requiring user interaction or submissions. They are perfect for:

- Lecture notes and course materials
- Reading assignments and supplementary content
- Course announcements and important information
- Reference materials and documentation

## Creating a Page Module

To create a page module:

1. Navigate to your course
2. Click "Add Module" or "Create Activity"
3. Select "Page" from the module types
4. Enter a title and description for your page
5. Use the rich text editor to create your content
6. Save as draft or publish when ready

## Rich Text Editor

The page module includes a full-featured rich text editor that supports:

- **Text formatting**: Bold, italic, underline, strikethrough
- **Headings**: Multiple heading levels (H1-H6)
- **Lists**: Ordered and unordered lists
- **Links**: Internal and external links
- **Images**: Inline images with alt text
- **Tables**: Create and format tables
- **Code blocks**: Syntax-highlighted code snippets
- **HTML**: Direct HTML editing for advanced users

## Module Status

Page modules follow the standard module lifecycle:

- **Draft**: Content is being created and edited; visible only to creator and granted users
- **Published**: Content is ready for students; visible to enrolled students
- **Archived**: Content is preserved but no longer active; hidden from students

## Best Practices

When creating page modules:

- **Use clear headings** to organize content hierarchically
- **Break up long content** into sections for better readability
- **Include images and diagrams** to enhance understanding
- **Add internal links** to connect related content within your course
- **Use lists** to present information clearly
- **Preview before publishing** to ensure formatting looks correct

## Editing Published Pages

Once a page module is published, you can still edit it. Changes will be visible to students immediately after saving. Consider:

- Adding a note about recent updates for transparency
- Keeping track of changes in important pages
- Using version history if available to review changes
