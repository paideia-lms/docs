Paideia LMS uses environment variables to configure database connections, file storage, API settings, and other system parameters. You can set environment variables in your hosting environment or by using a `.env` file in the directory where you run the Paideia CLI.

## Setting environment variables

### In your hosting environment

When deploying Paideia LMS to a hosting platform, you typically set environment variables through your hosting provider's control panel or configuration interface. This is the recommended approach for production deployments.

Common hosting platforms include:
- **Cloud VPS** (Hetzner, DigitalOcean, AWS EC2, etc.): Set environment variables in your systemd service file, `.bashrc`, or system environment
- **Docker**: Set environment variables in your `docker-compose.yml` file or through Docker's environment variable system
- **Kubernetes**: Use ConfigMaps and Secrets for environment variables
- **Platform-as-a-Service** (Heroku, Railway, Render, etc.): Set environment variables through their web interfaces or CLI tools

### Using `.env` files

For local development or when running the Paideia binary directly, you can create a `.env` file in the directory where you run the Paideia CLI.

Just create a `.env` file in your project directory and add your environment variables:

```ini title=".env"
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/paideia_db

# S3/MinIO
S3_URL=http://localhost:9000
S3_ACCESS_KEY=your-access-key
S3_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
S3_BUCKET=paideia-bucket
S3_REGION=us-east-1

# Payload
PAYLOAD_SECRET=your-secure-random-string

# Ports
PORT=3001
FRONTEND_PORT=3000

# CORS
CORS_ORIGINS=*

# Email
EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=info@paideialms.com
EMAIL_FROM_NAME=Paideia LMS
```

When you run the Paideia binary, it will automatically load environment variables from the `.env` file in the current directory.

:::tip[Security best practice]
Never commit your `.env` file to version control. Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to keep sensitive credentials safe.

### Using the command line

You can also set environment variables directly when running the Paideia binary:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/paideia_db" \
S3_URL="http://localhost:9000" \
S3_ACCESS_KEY="your-access-key" \
S3_SECRET_KEY="your-secret-key" \
S3_BUCKET="paideia-bucket" \
./paideia
```

## Environment variables reference

For a complete list of all available environment variables, including descriptions, default values, and whether they are required, see the [Installation and Setup guide](/en/install-and-setup/#environment-variables).

The environment variables include:

- **Database**: `DATABASE_URL` for PostgreSQL connection
- **Storage**: `S3_URL`, `S3_ACCESS_KEY`, `S3_SECRET_KEY`, `S3_BUCKET`, `S3_REGION` for S3-compatible storage
- **Security**: `PAYLOAD_SECRET` for encryption, `CORS_ORIGINS` for CORS configuration
- **Ports**: `PORT` for backend API, `FRONTEND_PORT` for frontend
- **Email**: `EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS`, `EMAIL_FROM_NAME`, `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS`, `RESEND_API_KEY`
- **Other**: `SANDBOX_MODE` for sandbox functionality

## Priority order

When Paideia LMS looks for environment variables, it uses the following priority order (highest to lowest):

1. **`.env` file**: Variables defined in the `.env` file in the current directory
2. **System environment variables**: Variables set in your system environment
3. **Default values**: Built-in defaults (if available)

This means that if you set an environment variable both in your system environment and in a `.env` file, the `.env` file value will take precedence.

## Security recommendations

1. **Never commit secrets**: Always add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file
2. **Use strong secrets**: Generate cryptographically secure random strings for `PAYLOAD_SECRET`
3. **Restrict CORS**: Replace `CORS_ORIGINS: "*"` with your actual domain(s) in production
4. **Use secure connections**: Use HTTPS URLs for `S3_URL` and `DATABASE_URL` in production
5. **Rotate secrets regularly**: Change passwords and API keys periodically

For more security best practices, see the [Installation and Setup guide](/en/install-and-setup/#security-recommendations).
