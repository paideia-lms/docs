Paideia LMS supports integrations with external systems and services, enhancing institutional capabilities and streamlining workflows.

## Overview

Integrations enable Paideia LMS to connect with external tools and services, enabling seamless data exchange, authentication, and enhanced functionality. This is particularly important for educational institutions that use multiple systems and need to connect them together.

## Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI)

Paideia LMS supports **Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI)**, a standard developed by 1EdTech (formerly IMS Global Learning Consortium) that enables seamless integration between learning systems and external educational tools.

LTI enables Paideia LMS to:

- Host course content or tools provided by external or third-party systems
- Allow learners to access external tools without separate logins
- Share learner information and learning context with external systems
- Allow external tools to send grade results back to Paideia LMS

LTI uses OAuth2, OpenID Connect, and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to provide secure authentication and data exchange. This standard is widely adopted by major educational content providers and learning management systems.

:::note[LTI Standard]
LTI is an industry standard that enables interoperability between different educational technology platforms. For more information, see the [Learning Tools Interoperability Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_Tools_Interoperability).

## Microsoft Integration

Paideia LMS includes built-in **Microsoft Integration** that supports the following features:

### Microsoft Teams

Integration with Microsoft Teams enables:

- Synchronizing course content and activities with Teams
- Seamless collaboration between Teams and Paideia LMS
- Accessing course materials directly from Teams

### Microsoft Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Many schools use Microsoft MFA for enhanced security. Paideia LMS supports Microsoft MFA configuration, enabling institutions to:

- Use Microsoft's authentication system for user logins
- Leverage existing Microsoft Active Directory (Azure AD) infrastructure
- Maintain consistent authentication policies across systems
- Provide users with a single sign-on experience

This integration is particularly valuable for educational institutions that have already invested in Microsoft's ecosystem and want to leverage their existing authentication infrastructure.

## Future Integrations

We're considering adding integrations with more sophisticated systems to enhance Paideia LMS capabilities. Potential integrations under consideration include:

- Additional authentication providers
- Video conferencing platforms
- Student Information Systems (SIS)
- Library management systems
- Assessment and monitoring tools
- Booking and scheduling systems

## Proposing New Integrations

We welcome proposals for new integrations! If you have ideas for integrations that would benefit your institution or the broader Paideia LMS community, feel free to:

- Start a discussion on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/paideia-lms/paideia/discussions)
- Share use cases and requirements
- Explain how the integration would benefit users

We're committed to building integrations that add real value to educational institutions using Paideia LMS. Your feedback helps determine which integrations we prioritize for development next.
