Paideia LMS supports integrations with external systems and services to enhance functionality and streamline workflows for educational institutions.

## Overview

Integrations allow Paideia LMS to connect with external tools and services, enabling seamless data exchange, authentication, and enhanced functionality. This is particularly important for educational institutions that use multiple systems and need them to work together.

## Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI)

Paideia LMS supports **Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI)**, a standard developed by 1EdTech (formerly IMS Global Learning Consortium) that enables seamless integration between learning systems and external educational tools.

LTI allows Paideia LMS to:

- Host course content and tools provided by external or third-party systems
- Allow learners to access external tools without separate logins
- Share learner information and learning context with external systems
- Enable external tools to send grade results back to Paideia LMS

LTI uses OAuth2, OpenID Connect, and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication and data exchange. This standard is widely adopted by major educational content providers and Learning Management Systems.

:::note[LTI Standard]
LTI is an industry standard that enables interoperability between different educational technology platforms. For more information, see the [Learning Tools Interoperability Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_Tools_Interoperability).

## Microsoft Integration

Paideia LMS includes built-in **Microsoft integration** with support for:

### Microsoft Teams

Integration with Microsoft Teams allows you to:

- Sync course content and activities with Teams
- Enable seamless collaboration between Teams and Paideia LMS
- Access course materials directly from Teams

### Microsoft Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Many schools use Microsoft MFA for enhanced security. Paideia LMS supports Microsoft MFA configuration, allowing institutions to:

- Use Microsoft's authentication system for user login
- Leverage existing Microsoft Active Directory (Azure AD) infrastructure
- Maintain consistent authentication policies across systems
- Provide a single sign-on experience for users

This integration is particularly valuable for educational institutions that have already invested in Microsoft's ecosystem and want to leverage their existing authentication infrastructure.

## Future Integrations

We are open to adding more integrations with sophisticated systems to enhance Paideia LMS functionality. Some potential integrations we're considering include:

- Additional authentication providers
- Video conferencing platforms
- Student information systems (SIS)
- Library management systems
- Assessment and proctoring tools
- Booking and scheduling systems

## Suggesting New Integrations

We welcome suggestions for new integrations! If you have ideas for integrations that would benefit your institution or the broader Paideia LMS community, please feel free to:

- Open a discussion on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/paideia-lms/paideia/discussions)
- Share your use case and requirements
- Describe how the integration would benefit users

We're committed to building integrations that add real value to educational institutions using Paideia LMS. Your feedback helps us prioritize which integrations to develop next.
