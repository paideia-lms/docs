Groups provide a way to organize students within courses, enabling group-based activities, collaborative assignments, and flexible permission management. Each group belongs to a specific course and can be used to control access, organize activities, and manage course settings.

## What are Groups?

Groups are collections of students within a course that can be used for various organizational purposes. When a student is enrolled in a course, they can be assigned to one or more groups. Groups help organize students into smaller cohorts, teams, or sections for better course management.

## Group Membership

Groups are managed through enrollments. When enrolling a student in a course, you can assign them to one or more groups. Students can belong to multiple groups simultaneously, allowing for flexible organization. For example, a student might be in both a "Section A" group and a "Project Team 1" group.

### Group Structure

Groups can be organized hierarchically, with parent and child groups. This allows for complex organizational structures such as:

- **Sections** - Large courses divided into manageable cohorts
- **Teams** - Students organized for collaborative projects
- **Lab Groups** - Students assigned to specific lab sessions
- **Discussion Groups** - Smaller discussion cohorts
- **Nested Hierarchies** - Multi-level organization (e.g., "Fall 2024" → "Section A" → "Team 1")

## Use Cases

### Module Permission Control

Groups can control which students have access to specific course modules. This allows you to:

- Restrict access to certain modules based on group membership
- Show different content to different groups
- Create group-specific activities and resources

### Group Assignments

Groups enable collaborative assignments where students work together in their assigned groups. This includes:

- Group-based assignments where all group members collaborate
- Group submissions where the entire group submits work together
- Peer assessment within groups using workshop activities

### Group Setting Override

Groups can override course-level settings, allowing for:

- Different due dates for different groups
- Group-specific activity settings
- Customized grading scales per group
- Different access rules for different groups

## Group-Based Activities

Groups enable various types of collaborative activities:

### Group Assignments

Assignments can be configured for group work, where all members of a group collaborate on a single submission. This encourages teamwork and reduces grading workload for large classes.

### Group Forums

Discussion forums can be set to visible or separate groups mode:

- **Visible Groups** - Students can see discussions from other groups but can only participate in their own group's discussions
- **Separate Groups** - Students can only see and participate in their own group's discussions

### Group Quizzes

Quizzes can be restricted to group members, allowing for group-based assessments or collaborative quiz activities.

### Conditional Activities

Activities can be configured so that access is restricted based on group membership. This allows you to:

- Show different resources to different groups
- Create group-specific learning paths
- Restrict access to advanced materials based on group assignment

## Benefits of Groups

Groups provide several advantages for course management:

- **Enhanced Collaboration** - Students work together in smaller, manageable teams
- **Simplified Grading** - Easier to manage and grade large classes by organizing students into groups
- **Diverse Interactions** - Students interact with different peers in various group contexts
- **Flexible Organization** - Support multiple organizational patterns simultaneously
- **Targeted Instruction** - Deliver different content and activities to different groups

## Managing Groups

Groups are managed through the course interface, where administrators and teachers can:

- Create new groups
- Assign students to groups during enrollment
- Modify group memberships
- Organize groups hierarchically
- Set group-specific settings and permissions

Group memberships are displayed as colored badges in the enrollment management interface, making it easy to see which groups each student belongs to.

:::note
Groups are course-specific - each course has its own independent group structure. Students can belong to multiple groups within the same course, allowing for flexible organization. Group membership is managed entirely through the enrollment record, ensuring consistency across the course.
