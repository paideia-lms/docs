The Media Drive is your personal storage space for all media files in Paideia LMS. Every file you upload is associated with your account, allowing you to view, organize, download, rename, and delete your media files. The Media Drive serves as the foundation for media uploads across assignments, notes, and other content types.

## Why Paideia Media Drive is Unique

Paideia's built-in Media Drive is a powerful feature that sets it apart from traditional Learning Management Systems. Unlike most LMS platforms that rely on external storage integrations (such as OneDrive, Google Drive, or Dropbox), Paideia provides a fully integrated media management system built directly into the platform.

### Built-In Integration

**Traditional LMS Limitations:**
- Most LMS platforms require integration with external cloud storage services
- External drives are separate systems from the LMS
- Permission and access control issues often arise when integration is not properly configured
- Students and instructors face difficulties accessing files due to permission mismatches
- File sharing becomes complex when crossing system boundaries

**Paideia's Advantage:**
- **Native Integration**: The media drive is built directly into the LMS, not a separate system
- **Automatic Permissions**: All permissions and access control are automatically configured by the system
- **No Permission Issues**: Since everything is within the same system, there are no cross-system permission conflicts
- **Seamless Access**: Students and instructors can access files without dealing with external authentication
- **Unified Experience**: All media operations work consistently across the entire platform

### Virtually Unlimited Storage

Paideia uses S3-compatible storage (such as AWS S3, MinIO, or other S3-compatible services), which provides:

- **Scalable Storage**: Storage capacity scales with your needs
- **Cost-Effective**: Pay only for what you use
- **Reliable**: Enterprise-grade storage infrastructure
- **No Hard Limits**: Unlike external integrations with storage quotas, Paideia's S3-based storage is virtually unlimited

Administrators can configure storage quotas per user if needed, but the underlying storage system can scale to accommodate any amount of data.

### Comprehensive Management

For administrators, Paideia provides detailed statistics and management tools:

- **Storage Analytics**: See which users are using how much storage
- **File Type Analysis**: Understand what types of files consume the most storage
- **Usage Tracking**: Monitor media file usage across the platform
- **Orphaned File Detection**: Identify and clean up unused files
- **System-Wide View**: Manage all media files from a single interface

These statistics are invaluable for:
- **Capacity Planning**: Understanding storage growth trends
- **Resource Management**: Identifying users with high storage usage
- **Cost Optimization**: Finding opportunities to optimize storage usage
- **System Health**: Monitoring overall system media usage

## Storage Quota

The Media Drive displays your storage usage with a visual donut chart:

### When Storage Limit is Set

- **Used Storage**: Shows how much storage you've used
- **Available Storage**: Shows how much storage remains
- **Chart Label**: Displays "X / Y" (used / limit)
- **Allowance Text**: Shows your total storage allowance

### When Storage is Unlimited

- **Allowance Text**: Shows "Unlimited"

The storage quota is configured by administrators and applies to all media files you upload, including those used in assignments, notes, and other content.

## Media Usage Tracking

Before deleting media files, you can check where they're being used:

### Viewing Media Usage

1. Click the action menu (three dots) on any media file
2. Select **"Show Usage"**
3. A modal will display all locations where the file is referenced

### Usage Information

The usage modal shows:

- **Total Usages**: Number of places the file is referenced
- **Usage Details**: Collection name, document ID, and field path for each usage

Common usage locations include:

- **User Avatars**: `users` collection, `avatar` field
- **Course Thumbnails**: `courses` collection, `thumbnail` field
- **Assignment Attachments**: `assignment-submissions` collection, `attachments[].file` field
- **Discussion Attachments**: `discussion-submissions` collection, `attachments[].file` field
- **Content Media**: `courses`, `pages`, `notes` collections, `media` relationship field

### Deletion Protection

If you attempt to delete a media file that is still in use, the system will:

1. Check for all usages before deletion
2. Prevent deletion if any usages are found
3. Display an error message with the media ID and usage count
4. Require you to remove all references before deletion

This protection prevents accidental deletion of files that are still referenced in your content.

## Best Practices

### Organizing Your Media

- **Use Descriptive Filenames**: Name files clearly to make them easy to find
- **Upload as Needed**: Upload files when you need them, rather than in bulk
- **Check Usage Before Deleting**: Always check usage before deleting files
- **Monitor Storage**: Keep an eye on your storage quota to avoid hitting limits

### File Management

- **Regular Cleanup**: Periodically review and delete unused files
- **Batch Operations**: Use batch deletion for cleaning up multiple files at once
- **Preview Before Use**: Use the preview feature to verify files before using them in content

### Storage Management

- **Optimize File Sizes**: Compress images and videos when possible
- **Use Appropriate Formats**: Choose file formats that balance quality and size
- **Monitor Quota**: Check your storage usage regularly to stay within limits

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot Upload Files

If you cannot upload files:

1. Check that your file size is within the upload limit
2. Verify that the file type is supported
3. Ensure you have available storage quota (if limits are set)
4. Check your internet connection
5. Contact your administrator if issues persist

### Files Not Appearing

If uploaded files don't appear:

1. Refresh the page
2. Check that you're viewing the correct user's media drive
3. Verify that the upload completed successfully
4. Check browser console for errors

### Cannot Delete Files

If you cannot delete files:

1. Check the usage modal to see where the file is referenced
2. Remove all references to the file before attempting deletion
3. Verify you have permission to delete the file (you can only delete your own files)
4. Contact your administrator if you need to delete files referenced by others

### Storage Quota Issues

If you're hitting storage limits:

1. Check your current usage in the storage chart
2. Delete unused files to free up space
3. Contact your administrator to request a quota increase
4. Consider optimizing file sizes before uploading
