[Moodle](https://moodle.org) is an open-source learning management system built with PHP.

## Key Similarities between Moodle and Paideia LMS

Moodle and Paideia LMS share some similarities that will help you migrate your courses and content:

- Both Moodle and Paideia LMS are feature-complete learning management systems with course management, user management, assignments, quizzes, and gradebooks.

- Both support course content organization with sections, categories, and modules.

- Both include user roles and permissions (admin, instructor, student, etc.).

- Both support various activity types including assignments, quizzes, discussions, and pages.

## Key Differences between Moodle and Paideia LMS

When you migrate from Moodle to Paideia LMS, you will notice several important differences:

- **Deployment:** Moodle requires PHP, a web server, and a database, while Paideia LMS deploys as a single binary. This makes installation and updates much simpler.

- **Technology Stack:** Moodle is built with PHP and older technologies, while Paideia LMS uses modern technologies (Bun, React Router v7, Elysia, TypeScript) for better performance and maintainability.

- **Plugin Architecture:** Moodle relies heavily on plugins for functionality, which can lead to compatibility issues and management overhead. Paideia LMS includes all essential features built-in, eliminating the need for plugins.

- **User Interface:** Moodle uses its own templating system, while Paideia LMS uses React with Mantine components for a modern, consistent UI.

- **Database:** Moodle uses MySQL/MariaDB/PostgreSQL, while Paideia LMS uses PostgreSQL exclusively, which provides better performance and scalability.

## Migrate from Moodle to Paideia LMS

To migrate your Moodle installation to Paideia LMS, follow these steps:

1. **Export your Moodle data:**
   - Export course content (courses, sections, activities)
   - Export user accounts and enrollment data
   - Export gradebook data and assessment results
   - Export discussion forums and submissions

2. **Install Paideia LMS:**
   - Download the Paideia LMS binary for your platform
   - Set up PostgreSQL database
   - Configure S3-compatible storage
   - Start the Paideia LMS server

3. **Import your data:**
   - Use Paideia LMS import tools to migrate courses
   - Import user accounts and set up enrollments
   - Transfer gradebook data
   - Migrate discussion forums and activity submissions

4. **Configure your LMS:**
   - Set up user roles and permissions
   - Configure course categories
   - Customize the appearance and branding

## Migration Considerations

When migrating from Moodle to Paideia LMS, keep in mind:

- **Plugins:** Moodle plugins will not work in Paideia LMS. Check if the functionality you need is available as a built-in feature in Paideia LMS. If custom functionality is needed, Paideia LMS's modern codebase is easier to extend.

- **Themes:** Moodle themes are not compatible with Paideia LMS. Paideia LMS uses React with Mantine components, which provides a modern, customizable UI out of the box.

- **Custom Blocks:** Moodle blocks are not supported in Paideia LMS. Similar functionality can be achieved through Paideia LMS's built-in features or custom development.

- **Activity Modules:** Most standard Moodle activity modules (assignments, quizzes, forums, etc.) have equivalents in Paideia LMS. Check the Paideia LMS documentation for feature parity.
