[Canvas](https://www.instructure.com/canvas) is a cloud-based learning management system built with Ruby on Rails.

## Key Similarities between Canvas and Paideia LMS

Canvas and Paideia LMS share some similarities that will help you migrate your courses and content:

- Both Canvas and Paideia LMS are feature-complete learning management systems with course management, user management, assignments, quizzes, and gradebooks.

- Both support course content organization with modules, pages, and assignments.

- Both include user roles and permissions (admin, instructor, student, TA, etc.).

- Both support various activity types including assignments, quizzes, discussions, pages, and files.

- Both have built-in LTI support for third-party integrations.

## Key Differences between Canvas and Paideia LMS

When you migrate from Canvas to Paideia LMS, you will notice several important differences:

- **Deployment:** Canvas is a cloud-based SaaS platform managed by Instructure, while Paideia LMS deploys as a single binary that you can self-host. This gives you full control over your data and infrastructure.

- **Technology Stack:** Canvas is built with Ruby on Rails and runs on cloud infrastructure, while Paideia LMS uses modern technologies (Bun, React Router v7, Elysia, TypeScript) for better performance and maintainability.

- **Cost:** Canvas requires a paid subscription, while Paideia LMS is free and open-source (AGPL-3.0), allowing you to self-host without licensing fees.

- **Customization:** Canvas has limited customization options and branding restrictions, while Paideia LMS's modern codebase makes it easy to customize and extend.

- **Data Ownership:** With Canvas, your data is stored on Instructure's servers. With Paideia LMS, you have full control over your data and can host it on your own infrastructure.

- **Database:** Canvas uses its own proprietary database infrastructure, while Paideia LMS uses PostgreSQL exclusively, which provides better performance and scalability.

## Migrate from Canvas to Paideia LMS

To migrate your Canvas installation to Paideia LMS, follow these steps:

1. **Export your Canvas data:**
   - Use Canvas API or export tools to export course content (courses, modules, pages, assignments)
   - Export user accounts and enrollment data via Canvas API
   - Export gradebook data and assessment results
   - Export discussion forums and submissions
   - Download course files and media assets

2. **Install Paideia LMS:**
   - Download the Paideia LMS binary for your platform
   - Set up PostgreSQL database
   - Configure S3-compatible storage
   - Start the Paideia LMS server

3. **Import your data:**
   - Use Paideia LMS import tools to migrate courses
   - Import user accounts and set up enrollments
   - Transfer gradebook data
   - Migrate discussion forums and activity submissions
   - Upload course files and media assets

4. **Configure your LMS:**
   - Set up user roles and permissions
   - Configure course categories and organization
   - Customize the appearance and branding
   - Set up LTI integrations if needed

## Migration Considerations

When migrating from Canvas to Paideia LMS, keep in mind:

- **Canvas Apps:** Canvas-specific apps and plugins will not work in Paideia LMS. Check if the functionality you need is available as a built-in feature in Paideia LMS. If custom functionality is needed, Paideia LMS's modern codebase is easier to extend.

- **Themes:** Canvas themes are not compatible with Paideia LMS. Paideia LMS uses React with Mantine components, which provides a modern, customizable UI out of the box with full branding control.

- **SpeedGrader:** Canvas's SpeedGrader functionality has equivalents in Paideia LMS's grading interface. Check the Paideia LMS documentation for grading workflows.

- **LTI Integrations:** Both platforms support LTI, so you may be able to reuse some of your LTI integrations. Check compatibility and adjust as needed.

- **Canvas Commons:** Content shared via Canvas Commons will need to be exported and imported separately. Consider using standard export formats for better compatibility.

- **API Access:** Canvas uses REST APIs for data access. Paideia LMS also provides APIs, but the structure may differ. Review the Paideia LMS API documentation for migration scripts.

- **Gradebook:** Canvas's gradebook features have equivalents in Paideia LMS. Review the Paideia LMS gradebook documentation to understand feature parity.
