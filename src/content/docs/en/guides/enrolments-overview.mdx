Enrolments are the mechanism that connects users to courses in Paideia LMS. Each enrolment record establishes a user's relationship with a specific course and defines their permissions within that course.

## What are Enrolments?

When a user is enrolled in a course, they gain access to that course's content and activities. The enrolment record stores important information about this relationship, including:

- **User** - The person who is enrolled
- **Course** - The course they are enrolled in
- **Role** - What the user can do in the course (see Course Roles below)
- **Status** - Whether the enrolment is active, inactive, completed, or dropped
- **Enrolment date** - When the user was enrolled
- **Completion date** - When the user completed the course (if applicable)
- **Groups** - Any groups or cohorts the user belongs to within the course

The system ensures that each user can only be enrolled once in any given course, preventing duplicate enrolments.

## Course Roles

Paideia LMS defines **four distinct enrolment roles** that determine what users can do within a specific course:

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Student** | Standard learner role for course participants |
| **Teacher** | Primary instructor with full course control |
| **Teaching Assistant (TA)** | Support role with limited instructor permissions |
| **Manager** | Administrative support role |

### Student

The standard learner role for course participants. Students can:

- View course content
- Submit assignments
- Take quizzes
- Participate in discussions

### Teacher

The primary instructor with full course control. Teachers can:

- Manage all course content
- Grade student work
- Manage enrolments
- Access course settings

### Teaching Assistant (TA)

A support role with limited instructor permissions. Teaching Assistants can:

- Grade student work
- View course settings
- Assist with course management tasks

### Manager

An administrative support role. Managers can:

- Manage enrolments
- Access course settings
- View reports and analytics

## Enrollment Status

Enrolments can have different statuses depending on the user's current state in the course:

- **Active** (default) - The user is actively enrolled and participating
- **Inactive** - The enrolment is temporarily paused
- **Completed** - The user has successfully completed the course
- **Dropped** - The user has withdrawn from the course

## Enrollment Management

Enrolments can be created and managed by users with appropriate permissions. Typically, course teachers and administrators can:

- Add new users to courses
- Change user roles within a course
- Update enrolment status
- Remove users from courses
- Assign users to groups or cohorts

## Group Membership

Enrolments can be associated with groups within a course, enabling organizational structures like sections, teams, or cohorts. This allows for better course organization and group-based activities.

## Enrollment Interface

The enrolment management interface provides a clear view of all course participants, showing:

- User details (name, email)
- Current role and status
- Last access information
- Options to edit or manage enrolments

Administrators and teachers can easily add new enrolments, modify existing ones, and manage course participants from this interface.

:::note
The enrolment system is distinct from system-wide user roles. A user might have the system role of `instructor` (allowing them to create courses) while being enrolled as a `student` in specific courses. Conversely, a user with the system role of `student` could be enrolled as a `teacher` in courses they instruct.

**The enrolment role always takes precedence for course-specific permissions**, meaning that within a course, the enrolment role determines what the user can do, regardless of their system-wide role.
