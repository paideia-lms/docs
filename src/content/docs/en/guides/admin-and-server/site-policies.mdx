- **Site Upload Limit**: Set maximum file size for all uploads
- **Unlimited Options**: Support for unlimited storage and upload sizes
- **Quick Presets**: Common values for quick configuration
- **Custom Values**: Precise control with custom byte values

## How Policies Are Applied

### Storage Quota Enforcement

The storage quota is displayed to users in their Media Drive:

- **Donut Chart**: Shows used vs available storage when a limit is set
- **Allowance Text**: Displays the configured limit or "Unlimited"
- **Real-Time Updates**: Chart updates as users upload or delete files

The quota applies to all media files uploaded by a user, including:

- User avatars
- Assignment attachments
- Note images
- Course thumbnails
- Discussion attachments
- Any other media files

### Upload Limit Enforcement

The upload limit is enforced at the point of upload across all routes:

- **User Media Drive**: File uploads respect the limit
- **Assignment Submissions**: File attachments respect the limit
- **Note Images**: Image uploads respect the limit
- **Course Thumbnails**: Thumbnail uploads respect the limit
- **User Avatars**: Avatar uploads respect the limit

When a file exceeds the limit:

1. The upload is rejected
2. An error message is displayed showing the maximum allowed size
3. The file size is formatted for readability (e.g., "File size exceeds maximum allowed size of 20 MB")

## Best Practices

### Setting Storage Quotas

- **Consider User Needs**: Set quotas based on typical usage patterns
- **Start Conservative**: Begin with lower quotas and increase as needed
- **Monitor Usage**: Review storage usage reports to adjust quotas
- **Account for Growth**: Plan for increased usage over time
- **Unlimited for Small Sites**: Consider unlimited storage for small deployments

### Setting Upload Limits

- **Balance Usability and Storage**: Set limits that allow necessary file types
- **Consider File Types**: Different content types may need different limits
- **Network Considerations**: Very large limits may cause timeout issues
- **Security**: Reasonable limits help prevent abuse
- **Default Values**: 20 MB is a good default for most use cases

### Policy Management

- **Document Changes**: Keep records of policy changes
- **Notify Users**: Inform users when policies change
- **Test Changes**: Verify that policy changes work as expected
- **Monitor Impact**: Watch for issues after policy changes

## Troubleshooting

### Policies Not Applying

If policies don't seem to be applying:

1. Verify you saved the changes (click "Save changes" button)
2. Refresh the page to see updated values
3. Check that you're viewing the correct policy settings
4. Verify database connectivity
5. Check system logs for errors

### Users Hitting Quota Limits

If users are hitting quota limits:

1. Review current storage usage in Admin Media Management
2. Consider increasing the quota if appropriate
3. Help users identify and delete unused files
4. Provide guidance on file optimization

### Upload Errors

If users are getting upload errors:

1. Verify the upload limit is set appropriately
2. Check that file sizes are within the limit
3. Review error messages for specific issues
4. Test uploads with different file types and sizes

### Unlimited Settings Not Working

If unlimited settings aren't working:

1. Verify that "Unlimited" was selected and saved
2. Check that the value is `null` in the database
3. Refresh the page to see updated settings
4. Verify system globals are being fetched correctly
