Cron jobs are scheduled tasks that run automatically in Paideia LMS. The admin cron jobs page provides comprehensive visibility into job execution history, allowing administrators to track job execution patterns, debug failures, and monitor system performance.

## Overview

The cron jobs feature provides administrators with:

- **Job History**: View execution history of all cron jobs
- **Status Monitoring**: See which jobs succeeded or failed
- **Error Details**: View detailed error messages for failed jobs
- **Execution Tracking**: Monitor job execution timestamps and patterns

## Accessing Cron Jobs

To access the cron jobs page:

1. Log in as an administrator
2. Navigate to **Admin → Server → Cron jobs**

You'll see a comprehensive view of all cron jobs and their execution history.

## Job History Display

The job history table displays detailed information about job executions:

### Table Columns

- **Job Name**: The name of the job (derived from task slug or queue)
- **Task Slug**: The task identifier
- **Queue**: The queue name
- **Executed At**: When the job started execution
- **Completed At**: When the job finished execution
- **State**: Job execution status (Succeeded or Failed)
- **Error**: Error message for failed jobs

### Status Indicators

- **Green Badge**: Job succeeded
- **Red Badge**: Job failed

### Error Display

Failed jobs display detailed error information:

- **Formatted Display**: Errors are displayed using CodeHighlight component
- **Copy Functionality**: Easy to copy error messages for further analysis
- **Format Support**: Supports both string and JSON error formats
- **Readable Format**: Errors are formatted for better readability

## Understanding Job Execution

### Successful Jobs

Successful jobs show:

- Green status badge
- Execution timestamps
- Completion timestamp
- No error message

### Failed Jobs

Failed jobs show:

- Red status badge
- Execution timestamps
- Completion timestamp (if available)
- Detailed error message

## Database Integration

Job history is retrieved directly from the database:

- **Source Tables**: `payload_jobs` and `payload_jobs_log`
- **Query Method**: Uses Drizzle ORM for database queries
- **Left Join**: Includes all jobs, even when log entries don't exist
- **Fallback Logic**: Handles cases where logs may not exist

### PostgreSQL Behavior

PostgreSQL only creates log entries in `payload_jobs_log` for failed jobs. The query uses a left join to ensure all jobs are included in the history, even when log entries don't exist.

## History Limit

The job history is limited to prevent performance issues:

- **Default Limit**: 100 entries
- **Sorting**: Most recent jobs first
- **Configurable**: Limit can be adjusted in the function

## Common Use Cases

### Monitoring Job Execution

Use the job history to:

- Track job execution patterns over time
- Identify jobs that fail frequently
- Monitor system performance
- Understand job execution status

### Debugging Failed Jobs

When a job fails:

1. Check the job history table
2. Find the failed job (red badge)
3. Review the error message
4. Copy the error for further analysis
5. Investigate the root cause

### Performance Monitoring

Monitor job execution to:

- Identify slow-running jobs
- Track job execution frequency
- Monitor system load
- Optimize job scheduling

## Best Practices

### Regular Monitoring

- Check job history regularly
- Monitor for failed jobs
- Review error messages
- Track execution patterns

### Error Analysis

- Copy error messages for analysis
- Review error details carefully
- Check system logs for additional context
- Investigate root causes

### Performance Optimization

- Monitor job execution times
- Identify slow-running jobs
- Optimize job scheduling
- Adjust job frequency if needed

## Troubleshooting

### Jobs Not Appearing in History

If jobs don't appear in history:

1. Check that jobs are actually running
2. Verify database connectivity
3. Check system logs for errors
4. Verify job configuration

### Missing Log Entries

If log entries are missing:

- This is normal for successful jobs in PostgreSQL
- The system uses fallback logic to show job information
- Check the `payload_jobs` table directly if needed

### Error Messages Not Displaying

If error messages aren't displaying:

1. Check that the job actually failed
2. Verify error format (string or JSON)
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify CodeHighlight component is working
