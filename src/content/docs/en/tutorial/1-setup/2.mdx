## Download the Paideia LMS binary

The single binary installation is the fastest way to get Paideia LMS running. Paideia LMS is distributed as a single executable file that contains everything you need.

<Steps>
1. Download the binary for your platform:

   <Tabs>
     <TabItem label="macOS ARM64">
       ```bash
       curl -L -o paideia https://github.com/paideia-lms/paideia/releases/latest/download/paideia-macos-arm64
       chmod +x paideia
       xattr -c paideia
       ```
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="Linux ARM64">
       ```bash
       curl -L -o paideia https://github.com/paideia-lms/paideia/releases/latest/download/paideia-linux-arm64
       chmod +x paideia
       ```
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="Linux x64">
       ```bash
       curl -L -o paideia https://github.com/paideia-lms/paideia/releases/latest/download/paideia-linux-x64
       chmod +x paideia
       ```
     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

2. Verify the installation by checking the version:

   ```bash
   ./paideia version
   ```

   You should see the Paideia LMS version number displayed, confirming the binary is working correctly.
