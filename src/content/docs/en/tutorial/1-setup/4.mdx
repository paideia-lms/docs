## Run database migrations

Paideia LMS uses database migrations to set up and update your database schema. When you first run Paideia LMS, migrations are automatically applied during startup. However, you can also run migrations manually using the CLI.

### Check migration status

<Steps>
1. Check the current migration status:

   ```bash
   ./paideia migrate status
   ```

   This will show you which migrations have been applied and which are pending.
</Steps>

### Run migrations

<Steps>
2. Run all pending migrations:

   ```bash
   ./paideia migrate up
   ```

   This will apply any migrations that haven't been executed yet.

   :::note[Automatic migrations]
   When you start Paideia LMS with `./paideia server`, migrations are automatically applied during startup. You only need to run migrations manually if you want to apply them before starting the server.
   :::

3. Verify migrations completed successfully:

   ```bash
   ./paideia migrate status
   ```

   All migrations should now show as "Applied".
</Steps>

### Database backup

<Steps>
4. (Optional) Create a database backup before proceeding:

   ```bash
   ./paideia migrate dump -o backup-before-setup.sql
   ```

   This creates a backup of your database that you can restore if needed.
</Steps>

:::tip[Migration best practices]

- Always check migration status before and after applying migrations
- Create backups before running migrations in production
- Test migrations in a development environment first
- Review the [CLI Reference](/en/reference/cli-reference/) for more migration commands
