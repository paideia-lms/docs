## What do I need to know to get started?

If you have some basic familiarity with **command-line interfaces** and **web applications**, then you're totally good to go! You'll be able to complete the entire tutorial just by following the instructions. Paideia LMS is designed to be accessible to everyone! 🧑‍🚀 👩‍🚀 👨‍🚀 

You will need:
- A computer running macOS or Linux
- Basic terminal/command-line knowledge
- Access to set up a PostgreSQL database and S3-compatible storage (or use Docker Compose)

<summary>How do I use the checklists at the bottom of each page?</summary>

You check them off!

At the end of each page, you'll find a clickable checklist of tasks you should now be able to do. Check these items off to see your progress in the Tutorial Tracker.

Using the tracker is optional, but it can help you remember your place if you complete the tutorial over multiple visits. You can also leave some checklists blank as a reminder of units that you want to revisit later.

<summary>Unit 1 is things I already know how to do. Can I skip it?</summary>

You can use the lessons inside [Unit 1](/en/tutorial/1-setup/) to make sure you have the tools and setup you'll need to complete the tutorial. It will walk you through installing Paideia LMS, setting up your database and storage, and configuring your environment.

If you [already have Paideia LMS installed](/en/install-and-setup/) and are comfortable with your setup, you can safely skip ahead to [Unit 2](/en/tutorial/2-users/) where you will start creating your first course.
