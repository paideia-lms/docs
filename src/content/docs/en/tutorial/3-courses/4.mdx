Now that you have students enrolled, let's organize them into groups! Groups enable collaborative activities, flexible permission management, and better course organization.

<PreCheck>
  - Create groups within your course
  - Assign students to groups during enrolment
  - Organize groups hierarchically
</PreCheck>

## Create groups in your course

<Steps>
1. Navigate to the course groups management interface. You can usually find this by clicking "Groups" or "Manage Groups" in your course.

2. Click "Create Group" or "New Group".

3. Enter group information:
   - **Name**: Enter a descriptive name, for example: "Section A" or "Project Team 1"
   - **Description** (optional): Add a brief description of the group's purpose
   - **Parent Group** (optional): Select a parent group if creating a nested group

4. Save the group.

   :::tip[Hierarchical groups]
   Groups can be organized hierarchically with parent and child groups. This enables complex organizational structures like:
   - "Fall 2024" → "Section A" → "Team 1"
   - "Lab Groups" → "Monday Lab" → "Group A"
   :::
</Steps>

## Assign students to groups

<Steps>
5. Assign students to groups during enrolment:

   - When enrolling a student, you can assign them to one or more groups
   - Students can belong to multiple groups simultaneously
   - For example, a student might belong to both "Section A" and "Project Team 1"

6. Assign existing students to groups:
   - Go to the enrolment management interface
   - Edit a student's enrolment
   - Add or remove group memberships
   - Save the changes

7. View group membership:
   - Group membership is displayed as colored badges in the enrolment interface
   - This makes it easy to see which groups each student belongs to
</Steps>

## Use groups for course activities

<Steps>
8. Understand how groups enable course activities:

   **Group Assignments**:
   - Configure assignments for group work
   - All group members collaborate on a single submission
   - Promotes teamwork and reduces grading workload

   **Group Forums**:
   - Set discussion forums to visible groups or separate groups mode
   - Students can see other groups' discussions (visible groups) or only their own (separate groups)

   **Group Quizzes**:
   - Restrict quizzes to group members
   - Enable group-based assessment or collaborative quiz activities

   **Module Access Control**:
   - Control which students have access to specific course modules based on group membership
   - Display different content to different groups
   - Create group-specific activities and resources
</Steps>

## Group organization example

Your course groups might be organized like this:

```
Fall 2024 Course
├── Section A
│   ├── Team 1
│   ├── Team 2
│   └── Team 3
├── Section B
│   ├── Team 1
│   └── Team 2
└── Lab Groups
    ├── Monday Lab
    └── Wednesday Lab
```
