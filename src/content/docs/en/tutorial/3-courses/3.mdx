Now that your course has content, it's time to enrol students! Enrolments connect users to courses and define their permissions within that course.

3. Select a user to enrol:
   - Search for users by name or email

   - **Status**: Set to Active (default), Inactive, Completed, or Dropped
   - **Groups** (optional): Assign the user to groups (we'll cover this in the next step)
