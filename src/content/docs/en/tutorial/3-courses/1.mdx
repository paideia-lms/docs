Now that you have activity modules created, it's time to organize them into a course! Courses provide structure for your learning content and allow you to manage student access.

<PreCheck>
  - Create a new course
  - Organize the course with sections
  - Assign the course to a category (optional)
</PreCheck>

## Create a new course

<Steps>
1. Navigate to the course creation area. You can usually find this by clicking "Create Course" or "New Course" in the course management interface.

2. Enter course information:
   - **Title**: Enter a descriptive title for your course, for example: "Introduction to Paideia LMS"
   - **Description**: Add a brief description of what the course covers
   - **Category** (optional): Select or create a category to organize your course

3. Click "Create" or "Save" to create your course.

   :::tip[Course categories]
   Categories help organize your course catalog. You can create nested categories for hierarchical organization. For example, "Computer Science" → "Programming" → "Web Development".
   :::
</Steps>

## Organize your course with sections

<Steps>
4. Create course sections to organize your content:

   Sections provide a way to structure your course content logically. You can create:
   - **Top-level sections**: Main units or weeks
   - **Nested sections**: Subsections within main sections

5. Create your first section:
   - Click "Add Section" or "New Section" in your course
   - Enter a section name, for example: "Week 1: Introduction"
   - Optionally add a description
   - Save the section

6. Create nested sections (optional):
   - Within a section, you can create child sections
   - For example, within "Week 1: Introduction", create:
     - "Day 1: Getting Started"
     - "Day 2: Basic Concepts"

   :::tip[Section organization]
   Sections can be nested to create hierarchical structures. This allows you to organize content at multiple levels, such as weeks → days → topics.
   :::

7. Reorder sections as needed:
   - Use drag-and-drop or ordering controls to arrange sections
   - Sections and modules are ordered within each section, controlling the sequence students encounter content
</Steps>

## Course structure

Your course now has a structure like this:

```
Introduction to Paideia LMS
├── Week 1: Introduction
│   ├── Day 1: Getting Started
│   └── Day 2: Basic Concepts
├── Week 2: Advanced Topics
└── Week 3: Final Project
```

Each section can contain:
- **Child sections** (nested subsections)
- **Activity modules** (pages, quizzes, assignments, etc.)
