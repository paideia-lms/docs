Now that you have a course with sections, it's time to add your activity modules to the course! Modules are linked to courses, allowing you to reuse the same module in multiple courses.

<PreCheck>
  - Link activity modules to course sections
  - Configure course-specific module settings
  - Reorder modules within sections
</PreCheck>

## Link modules to course sections

<Steps>
1. Navigate to the section where you want to add a module.

2. Click "Add Module" or "Link Module" in the section.

3. Select a module from your module library:
   - You'll see a list of modules you have access to
   - Select the module you want to add to this section
   - The module will be linked to the course section

4. Configure the module order:
   - Specify the order of the module within the section
   - You can reorder modules later using drag-and-drop or ordering controls

   :::tip[Module reusability]
   A single activity module can be linked to multiple courses. This means you can create a module once and reuse it across different courses, saving time and ensuring consistency.
   :::
</Steps>

## Configure course-specific settings

<Steps>
5. Configure course-specific settings for the module:

   When a module is added to a course, it becomes a **course module** with course-specific settings. These settings allow you to customize how the module behaves within this particular course.

6. Set module-specific options:
   - **Custom module name**: Override the default module name for this course
   - **Due dates** (for interactive modules): Set submission deadlines
   - **Open/Close dates**: Control when the module is available to students
   - **Cutoff dates**: Allow late submissions with penalties

   :::note[Course module settings]
   Course module settings only affect how the module appears and behaves in this specific course. They don't change the module's default configuration or affect its use in other courses.
   :::

7. Save your course module settings.
</Steps>

## Add multiple modules

<Steps>
8. Add more modules to your course:

   - Repeat the process to add modules to different sections
   - You can add the same module to multiple sections or courses
   - Organize modules logically within each section

9. Reorder modules as needed:
   - Use drag-and-drop or ordering controls
   - Modules are ordered within each section, controlling the learning sequence
</Steps>

## Module organization example

Your course might now look like this:

```
Introduction to Paideia LMS
├── Week 1: Introduction
│   ├── Day 1: Getting Started
│   │   ├── Welcome Page (page module)
│   │   └── Course Overview Quiz (quiz module)
│   └── Day 2: Basic Concepts
│       ├── Concepts Page (page module)
│       └── Practice Quiz (quiz module)
└── Week 2: Advanced Topics
    ├── Advanced Concepts (page module)
    └── Final Assignment (assignment module)
```
