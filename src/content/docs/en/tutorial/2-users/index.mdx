Now that you have Paideia LMS installed and running, it's time to personalize your account and start creating content!

## Looking ahead

In this unit, you will:
- Update your user profile (upload an avatar, update your bio)
- Create activity modules (page, whiteboard, quiz, assignment, discussion)
- Create and manage notes

Along the way, you'll learn how to use Paideia LMS's module system to create engaging learning content, and how to use notes for personal journaling.
