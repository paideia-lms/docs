## Create a new note

<Steps>
1. Navigate to your profile or notes section. You can usually find this by clicking on your name or avatar in the top navigation bar, then selecting "Notes" or "My Notes".

2. Click "Create Note" or "New Note" button.

   You should see a note editor with:
   - **Rich text editor** - A TipTap editor for writing your note with visual formatting tools
   - **Image upload** - Option to add images to your note
   - **Visibility settings** - Option to set note as public or private
   - **Save button** - To save your note
</Steps>

## Add content to your note

3. Write your note content using the rich text editor:

   The TipTap editor provides a visual toolbar with formatting options. You can:
   - **Format text**: Use the toolbar buttons to make text bold, italic, or underlined
   - **Add headings**: Select heading levels (H1-H6) from the toolbar
   - **Create lists**: Use the toolbar to create ordered or unordered lists
   - **Add links**: Insert internal and external links using the link button
   - **Format paragraphs**: Adjust alignment and spacing

   Example note content:
   - Start with a heading: "My Learning Journey"
   - Add a paragraph: "Today I learned how to create activity modules in Paideia LMS!"
   - Create a list of what you created:
     - A page module with rich text content
     - A whiteboard module with visual diagrams
     - A quiz module with multiple choice questions
   - Add another heading: "Key Takeaways"
   - Add more content about what you learned

   The TipTap editor supports rich text formatting, allowing you to create well-structured entries with:
   - **Headings**: Multiple heading levels (H1-H6)
   - **Text formatting**: Bold, italic, underline, strikethrough
   - **Lists**: Ordered and unordered lists
   - **Links**: Internal and external links
   - **Code blocks**: Syntax-highlighted code snippets
   - **Tables**: Create and format tables
</Steps>
