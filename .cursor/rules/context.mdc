this project is originally the astro docs, but we want to make it into our paideia lms docs. 

this doc is done using astro starlight. 

when you update a page (usually a mdx file), you should update the sidebar.ts file to reflect the changes. also update the translations.

use mermaid or d2 to illustrate ideas.

below is a advanced example of a d2 diagram.

```d2
network: {
  cell tower: {
    satellites: {
      shape: stored_data
      style.multiple: true
    }

    transmitter

    satellites -> transmitter: send
    satellites -> transmitter: send
    satellites -> transmitter: send
  }

  online portal: {
    ui: {shape: hexagon}
  }

  data processor: {
    storage: {
      shape: cylinder
      style.multiple: true
    }
  }

  cell tower.transmitter -> data processor.storage: phone logs
}

user: {
  shape: person
  width: 130
}

user -> network.cell tower: make call
user -> network.online portal.ui: access {
  style.stroke-dash: 3
}

api server -> network.online portal.ui: display
api server -> logs: persist
logs: {shape: page; style.multiple: true}

network.data processor -> api server
```
