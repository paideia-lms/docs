# Internationalization Guides

This directory contains guides for translators of different languages.

Each language is free to maintain these guides as is helpful to them.
They can be useful for sharing glossaries of agreed translations, stylistic decisions, and other information that might help fellow translators contribute.

General information about the translation process can by found in our contributing guides:

- [How to translate Astro’s docs](https://contribute.docs.astro.build/guides/i18n/)
- [How to review translation PRs](https://contribute.docs.astro.build/reviewers/reviewing-translations/)

## Languages
